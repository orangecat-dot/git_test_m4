        <h1><strong><em>Sunday</em></strong></h1>
        <h2>Calling home</h2>
        <p>Few days of <em>gloominess and rain</em>. As if some celestials were burnt out of their pathologic people pleaser syndrome, 
        decided to stop giving sunshine and to burst out in tears and sorrow. I made a call to mum and learnt that gray clouds
        are also clogging my home sky and my mother's mind and heart. <b> This is a b tag</b></p>

          <p>Unordered list is created using <ul> element and and each item within the list is created using the list item element <li>:
            <ul>
                <li>Anora</li>
                <li>Mickey 17</li>
                <li>I who have never known men</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Ordered lists are created using the <ol> element. Each individual item in them is again created using the list item element <li>. However, each list item in an ordered list begins with a number instead:
            <ol>
                <li>Learn programming</li>
                <li>crochet</li>
                <li>read</li>
                <li>work</li>
                <li>French homework</li>
            </ol>
